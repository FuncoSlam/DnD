# Session 2
Arrived in [[Korshire]]. [[Yurich]] was accused of murdering the Blacksmiths daughter.

The corpse was mangled beond recognition, it looked as if she exploded. A set of animal footprints were found leading away from the body.

The tracks lead the party to a shack in the woods. The inside of the shack was trashed, appearing to be a home for two.

Meet with [[Corsar]] when heading back to the village. Very sussy. Warned us not to go back to town.
