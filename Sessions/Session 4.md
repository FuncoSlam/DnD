In the fighting [[Mylrys]] and [[Oakly]] died.

We visited [[Alon City]] and realizd the extoritionate price of arrows. We sell some miscilaneous goods at the general store. [[Piradory]] and[[Bjorn]] were arrested and [[Arjhan]] joined the party. While escaping from prison [[Bjorn]] killed 4 guards.

We FINALLY crossed the bridge and approached the walled city of [[Mirinberg]]. After declaring their possessions and magical abilities [[Uradech]], [[Nrcoa]] and [[Arjhan]] made it through the main gate. [[Bjorn]] was smuggled in as one of [[Uradech]]'s familiars.
